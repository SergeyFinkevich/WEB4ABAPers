        <p>London is the capital of Great Britain, its political, economic and cultural centre. It's one of the largest
            cities in the world. Its population is more than million people. London is situated on the river Thames. The
            city is very old and beautiful. It was founded more than two thousand years ago. Traditionally London is
            divided into several parts: the City, the West End, the East End and Westminster. The City is the oldest
            part of London, its financial and business centre. The heart of the City is the Stock Exchange. Westminster
            is the most important part of the capital. It's the administrative centre. The Houses of Parliament, the
            seat of the British Government, are there. It's a very beautiful building with two towers and a very big
            clock called Big Ben. Big Ben is really the bell which strikes every quarter of an hour. Opposite the Houses
            of Parliament is Westminster Abbey. It's a very beautiful church built over 900 years ago. The tombs of many
            great statesmen, scientists and writers are there.</p>
