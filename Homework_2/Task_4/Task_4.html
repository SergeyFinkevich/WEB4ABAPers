            <h2>PSG 'line up late £90m Eriksen swoop'.</h2>
            <p class="bold">
                Paris Saint-Germain have earmarked Tottenham midfielder Christian Eriksen as a late transfer target
                should
                Neymar complete his return to Barcelona.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eriksen has found himself out of favour with Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino after he admitted
                earlier
                this
                summer that he wanted a 'new challenge'.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Denmark international was linked with a move to
                Manchester
                United,
                but after the transfer failed to materialise, he has been left out of Tottenham's starting line-out
                twice
                this
                season.
            </p>
            <p>
                The 27-year-old was reportedly holding out for a move to Real Madrid, but French outlet Le Parisien
                say
                that
                PSG
                is now his most likely destination.
            </p>
            <p>The Ligue 1 champions are set to bid £90 million for
                Eriksen
                - but only if a fee with Barcelona for Neymar is agreed.</p>

            <p>Pochettino has played down claims that the player's absence from his side has been as a result of
                the
                ongoing speculation surrounding his future.
            </p>

            <p>
                European clubs have until September 2 to conclude their transfer business for the summer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Spurs could lose Eriksen on a free transfer next summer if the Dane decides to run down his current
                contract.

            <h2>Ruthless Liverpool dispatch Burnley to maintain perfect start to the season.</h2>
            <p class="bold">
                Premier League, Turf Moor - Burnley 0 Liverpool 3 (Wood OG 33', Mane 37', Firmino 80')
            </p>
            <p>
                Liverpool secured a club record 13th successive top-flight victory to reclaim top spot in the Premier
                League, comfortably overcoming Burnley at Turf Moor.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Reds, who had to absorb some early pressure, took the lead in extraordinary circumstances in the
                31st-minute when Trent Alexander-Arnold's deep cross took a deflection off Chris Wood and looped over
                the backpedalling Burnley goalkeeper Nick Pope.
            </p>
            <p>There was nothing fortunate about Liverpool's second some six minutes later. A misplaced pass from Ben
                Mee straight to Roberto Firmino put his team in all kinds of trouble and the Brazilian threaded it
                through to Sadio Mane who finished with aplomb.
            </p>
            <p>
                Burnley stayed in the contest until 10 minutes before time, when they left themselves short at the back
                and Firmino put the game to bed with a well-taken finish from the edge of the penalty area after an
                incisive breakaway.
            </p>
            <p>The result means Jurgen Klopp’s side have four wins from four matches at the start of the season,
                averaging three goals a game and move two points ahead of Manchester City, who thrashed Brighton 4-0
                earlier on the day.
            </p>
            <p>
                In spite of all the positives and superlatives to come their way, Jurgen Klopp may, however, be quizzed
                on Mane's bizarre reaction to being substituted late on.
            </p>
            <p>
                Burnley remain 11th with four points.
