        <h1>10 Scientific Benefits of Being a Cat Owner</h1>
        <p>Studies have shown that just watching cat videos on the internet can boost a person's energy and create
            positive emotions—
            so it's no surprise that actual cat ownership has a number of benefits. Here are a few.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Owning a cat is better for the environment.</h2>
            <p> If you're worried about your carbon footprint, it’s better to own a cat than a dog. A 2009 study found
                that the resources needed to feed a dog over
                the course of its life create the same eco-footprint as that of a Land Cruiser. Meanwhile, cats—which
                eat
                less in general and are more likely to eat fish
                than corn- or beef-flavored products—only have the approximate carbon footprint of a small hatchback.

            <h2>They'll help you cope...</h2>
            <p> Losing a loved one is incredibly painful, but one of the best ways of coping is to own a pet.
                Cats have been shown to help people get over their loss more quickly, and show less physical symptoms of
                pain, like crying.
                Despite the fact that they are only animals, cats serve as a social support during difficult times.
                People in mourning report talking to their pet to work out their feelings, since it is often easier to
                talk to something that won’t respond and can’t judge than to another human being.

            <h2>... and find a significant other.</h2>
            <p> If you’re a single guy and you can’t seem to get a date, get a cat!
                A British poll found that 82 percent of women agreed they are more attracted to men who like animals.
                And while having a dog will do wonders for your dating life, a whopping 90 percent of single women said
                that men who
                own a cat are “nicer” than other guys. Listing that you own a cat on your dating profile could do
                wonders
                for the number
                of responses you get—but remember, a cat is for life, not just until you find a partner.

            <h2>Cat owners are smart.</h2>
            <p> A 2010 survey of British pet owners by the University of Bristol found that people who owned cats were
                more likely to have
                college degrees than their dog loving counterparts. In 2014, a researcher in Wisconsin surveyed 600
                college students and found
                that cat owners were actually more intelligent as well. (But it's probably not the cat itself making the
                owner smarter: The researchers
                conducting the Bristol survey said that smarter people tend to work longer hours, and since cats require
                less attention than dogs, they
                are a better choice for the busy intellectual.)

            <h2>You'll have a healthier heart.</h2>
            <p> Owning any pet is good for your heart. Cats in particular lower your stress level—possibly since they
                don’t require as much effort
                as dogs—and lower the amount of anxiety in your life. Petting a cat has a positive calming effect. One
                study found that over a 10-year
                period cat owners were 30 percent less likely to die of a heart attack or stroke than non-cat owners
                (although this might just be because
                cat owners are more relaxed and have lower stress in general).

            <h2>They fulfill your need for companionship.</h2>
            <p> The stereotype that dogs are more affectionate than cats is just that: a stereotype. In fact, it turns
                out that cats can be just
                as good of companions as dogs, especially for women. An Austrian study conducted in 2003 found that
                having a cat in the house is
                the emotional equivalent of having a romantic partner. As well as initiating contact much of the time,
                studies have shown cats will
                remember kindness shown to them and return the favor later.
            </p>
            <p>
                But cats really do have the upper hand in these relationships. After thousands of years of
                domestication,
                cats have learned how to make a half purr/half howl noise that sounds remarkably like a human baby’s
                cry.
                And since our brains are programmed to respond to our children’s distress, it is almost impossible to
                ignore what a cat wants when it
                demands it like that.

            <h2>They can tell you (and others!) a lot about your personality.</h2>
            <p> Your choice of pet reveals something about your personality. While dog lovers tend to be the life of the
                party,
                cat owners are quieter and more introverted. However, they score very highly when it comes to how
                trustworthy they are and how much
                they trust other people. Cat owners are also less manipulative and more modest.

        <section>
            <h2>You'll sleep better.</h2>
            <p> Several studies and polls in the UK have found that people (especially women) prefer to sleep with their
                cats than with
                their partners, and they even report sleeping better with a cat than with a human. A recent study from
                the Mayo Clinic Center
                for Sleep Medicine indicates that they might be on to something: 41 percent of the people in that study
                indicated that they slept
                better because of their pet, while only 20 percent said that it led to disturbances.

            <h2>Cat ownership means fewer allergies.</h2>
            <p> Sadly, it’s too late for you, but if you have a child on the way, it might be time to get a cat. In
                2002,
                the National Institutes of Health released a study that found children under a year old who were exposed
                to a cat were
                less likely to develop allergies—and not just pet allergies. According to Marshall Plaut, M.D., chief of
                the allergic mechanisms
                section at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, "high pet exposure early in life
                appears to protect against
                not only pet allergy but also other types of common allergies, such as allergy to dust mites, ragweed,
                and grass." And while the
                cat parasite Toxoplasma gondii is a threat to young children, experts say that by changing your cat’s
                litter box every day and keeping
                the animal indoors, you should be safe and allergy free!

            <h2>They can quite literally save your life.</h2>
            <p> Cats have a reputation of being aloof and not caring about their humans, but they have saved countless
                lives over the years.
                One cat in the United Kingdom warns her human when he’s about to have an epileptic seizure, while a cat
                in Montana woke up its two
                humans when a gas pipe started leaking. Firefighters told the couple that the house could easily have
                exploded if not for cat’s intervention.
            </p>
            <p>
                One cat has even received the highest medal available to military animals.
                Simon the cat was onboard the HMS Amethyst, which was sailing up the Yangtze in 1949 when a shell hit
                the
                ship,
                killing several marines and severely injuring Simon. (The event marked the beginning of the 101-day
                siege
                of the ship,
                which would become known as the Yangtze Incident.) Simon was fixed up, and despite being injured,
                performed his ship duty
                and started catching the rats that were threatening the ship’s food supply, as well as providing moral
                support for the surviving sailors.
                Simon died not long after the ship returned to the UK, but he was posthumously awarded the UK’s Dickin
                Medal, recognized as the animal
                Victoria Cross, for "behaviour [of] the highest order, although the blast was capable of making a hole
                over a foot in diameter in a steel
                plate."
